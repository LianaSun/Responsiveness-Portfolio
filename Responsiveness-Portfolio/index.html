            Hi! I'm Liana Morrison and I'm currently enrolled at the University of Minnesotas Coding Bootcamp.
            I have a BA in Dietetics and an Applied MBA in Small Business & Entreprentureship.
            For the last 12 years, I've managed yoga studios across the country and have contracted
            with over 25 studios. I have taught over 6,000 classes and lead over 50 workshops, privates and events.
            My clients have included Lady Gaga and Peter Van Der Veen. I currently partner with a boutique studio in
            Minneapolis -
            Open Minds Fusion Studio. My passion project is the Minnesota Dancers Collective, which promotes safer,
            earlier Dance Parties throughout the twin cities.
            I'm also a mom to the best 5-year old girl in the world and our family includes a 5 year-old Corgi-mix
            named Penny and a Western Hognose Snake named Magical.
            The snake in my bio pic is from our friend, Emily's collection - an 8ft boa constrictor named Doug!
